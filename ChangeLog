2010-03-29, Version 1.1.2
	* librouteros(3): Two memory leaks have been fixed in “ros_query” and
	  “ros_connect”.

2010-01-04, Version 1.1.1
	* ros_system_resource: Report bytes rather than KiBibytes. The CPU
	  frequency is reported in Hertz rather than Megahertz.

2009-12-25, Version 1.1.0
	* ros_system_resource: Added high-level interface for
	  “/system/resource/print”.
	* ros: The “system-resource” high-level command has been added.
	* ros: Usage output has been improved.
	* librouteros(3): Versioning information has been added.

2009-12-22, Version 1.0.1
	* ros_query: Sanity check the arguments. Passing NULL as connection
	  pointer (and possibly other arguments) would lead to a segmentation
	  fault when the null pointer was dereferenced. Thanks to Andrey
	  Ponomarenko for pointing out the problem.
	* routeros_api.h: Include <stdbool.h> when compiling with g++. As a
	  GNU extension, this will define _Bool for C++ programs.

2009-12-18, Version 1.0.0
	* Code cleanup: Avoid compiler warnings.

2009-11-27, Version 0.2.0
	* High-level interfaces have been added for "interface" and
	  "registration-table".
